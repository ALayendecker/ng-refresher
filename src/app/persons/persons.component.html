<!--
  angular allows for conditional renders using ngIf
  all we had to do was set the boolean to toggle inside our class and ngOnInit
-->
<p *ngIf="isFetching">Loading...</p>

<ul *ngIf="!isFetching">
  <!-- ngfor can be used to loop inside html this is called a directive -->
  <li *ngFor="let person of personList" (click)="onRemovePerson(person)">
    {{ person }}
  </li>
</ul>
